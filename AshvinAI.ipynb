Apnea events were identified as a 10 or more second\\nperiod of at least 80% reduced airflow. Hypopneas events were identified as a 10 or more second period of at least\\n30% reduced airflow and a4 or more % drop in oxygen saturation. Obstructive apnea events show an effart to\\nbreathe; central events shaw no effort to breathe,\\n\\nSTUDY OVERVIEW: The study was performed on 4/3/2023. The recording was started at 14:10 PM and ended at 7:17\\nAM for a total recording duration of 8 hours and 7 minutes. Total sleep time was 2h 57 min.\\n\\nRESPIRATORY EVENT SUMMARY: The patient had 4 apneas, there are 4 obstructive, 0 unclassified, 0 central and 0\\nmixed apneas; and 57 hypopneas for 2 cambined apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 20.7 respiratory events per hour,\\nThere were 1799 snoring events recorded.\\n\\nOXYGENATION: The patient\\'s average oxygen saturation was 91, and the lowest saturation was 81%. There\\nwere 36.03 minutes (20.4%) below 90% saturation. There were 2,18 minutes (1.2%) below 85% saturation.\\n\\nPULSE RATE: The patient had a minimum heart rate of 46 beats/minute, a maximum heart rate of 77 beats/minute;\\nand an average heart rate of 61 beats/minute,\\n\\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: Moderate obstructive sleep apnea (G47.33).\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: The patient will benefit from treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. AutoPAP/CPAP/BIPAP\\ntherapy Is generally the most effective form of therapy and [s suggested in this case. There are other therapeutic\\noptions including mandibular advancement devices, and surgical procedures, and these would have to be discussed\\nin detail before their application.\\n\\nConsider initiating treatment with automatic positive airway pressure (auta-PAP) with heated humidification,\\npressure between 4 to 20 cmH20, and mask of the patient\\'s choice. Compliance card analysis for the compliance and\\nadequacy of AutoPAP/CPAP treatment is warranted in 4-6 weeks.\\n\\n[. Advise the patient to exercise caution while driving a motor vehicle at all times.\\n64/86/23) 18:11:18 813-313-5933 -> Trinity Health Vortex Orders Page 442\\n\\n \\n\\nFax: 813-313-5933\\n\\nMEDICAL SERVICES\\n\\ne BLACKSTONE Phone. 813-831-2727 / 888-710-2727\\n\\n2.

The following parameters were monitored:\\nFrontal, central and occipital EEG, electroculogram (EOG}, submentalis EMG, nasal and oral airflow, anterior tibialis\\nEMG, body position and electrocardiogram. Additionally, thoracic and abdominal movements were recorded by\\ninductance plethysmography. Oxygen saturation (sp02) was monitored using a pulse oximeter, The tracing was\\nscored using 30 second epochs. Hypopneas were scored per AASM definition.\\n\\nA Central Apnea was defined as a cessation of oral and nasal airflow with simultaneous cessations of respiratory\\nmovements for at least 10 seconds (2 respiratory cycles in children).\\n\\nAn Obstructive Apnea was defined as a cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds (2 respiratory cycles in children)\\nin the presence of continuous respiratory movements.\\n\\nHypopneas were scored per AASM definition.\\n\\nBrief Clinical History\\nThis Patient is a 44 year old Male who underwent a diagnostic polysomnogram in an effort to determine the etiology of\\nthe patient's complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, loud snoring and frequent arousals from sleep.\\n\\nSleep Data:\\nThe study began at 9:48:48 PM.
